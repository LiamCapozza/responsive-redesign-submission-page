        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The purpose of this project was to take a website with low
          accessibility and outdated ui design and redesign it to be more
          responsive, specifically to ensure that there were sizes available for
          mobile, tablet, and desktop. I chose a construction company based in
          Providence, RI at random. Their website was outdated and not
          responsive at all.

        <h2>RP Construction Website Issues</h2>
        <p>
          The RP Construction website had a multitude of issues. At first
          glance, it appeared as though the site was cut in half, with only one
          side of the screen being taken up by content. There were also many
          contrasting problems, with some text being too small or difficult to
          read. Structure was another issue this site had, as there was none of
          it. A screen reader could not navigate the site well at all.

        <h2>Redesign Process</h2>
        <p>
          After identifying the main challenges I wanted to address, I started
          with sketching out ideas I could possibly put into fruition. These
          sketches allowed me to create my low-fi wireframes, as pictured below.
        </p>
        <img src="lowfidesktop.png" alt="low fidelity wireframe for desktop" />
        <img src="lowfitablet.png" alt="low fidelity wireframe for tablet" />
        <img src="lowfimobile.png" alt="low fidelity wireframe for mobile" />
        <p>
          After completing my low fidelity wireframes, I moved onto a style
          guide to allow for easier design after I had choosen the elements I
          could recreate over and over again.
        </p>
        <img
          src="styleguide.png"
          alt="style guide with colors, fonts, and icons"
        />
        <p>
          After the style guide was created, I was able to make my high fidelity
          wireframes, which included much more detail and color.

        <h2>Final Coding and Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          After finishing my wireframes and planning, I was able to code using
          css and html the site that I wanted. I was unable to add some of the
          features I was hoping for, such as the dropdown menu and the working
          photo carousel.
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't replicate what I created in Figma into css and html
          perfectly, but I am happy with the functionality of the
          responsiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
          I added some extra photos and testimonials just to create a more
          engaging website
